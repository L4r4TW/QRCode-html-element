## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I understood the basics of Flexbox. This project also helped me see how widely used HTML and CSS cards are created.

Here is an example of the flexbox I used:

```css
#card{
    display: flex; /* use flexbox */
    justify-content: center; /* center horizontally */
    align-items: center; /* center vertically */
    flex-direction: column;
    max-width: 350px;
    border-radius: 20px;
    padding: 1rem;
    background-color: #fff;
    box-shadow: 5px 5px 50px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
```

### Continued development

The usage of different CSS units (% ,rem, em, vw, etc.) can be a bit overwhelming, so I want to improve my understanding of this topic. I will also practice responsive design.
